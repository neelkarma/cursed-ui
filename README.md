# Cursed UI

A collection of cursed UI components that I (a usually back-of-the-front-end dev that almost exclusively uses css frameworks) made... _**from scratch.**_ (well if you consider tailwindcss with framer-motion "from scratch" but that's besides the point)

Hopefully they're alright.

## How to Run

This is a NextJS project, so use `yarn dev` to run the development server and `yarn build` to export to static html. No server-side rendering is used here, so you don't have to worry about that.
